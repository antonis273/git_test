# git_test

# Welcome to my github page! 

I am not a professional developer (yet). I am just learning the basics of Web Development via the Odin Project (which is pretty awesome and recommended --I get not sales-bonuses).

This repository will primarily be composed of the exercises that I will do while learning the basics.

# The Evim that men do

Many people (nobody) ask me which text editor I use. I use VS-Code for editing and Emacs org-mode for creative thinking. 

# Coding for Therapy

This seems like a great topic to explore. I will explore and if I find something interesting I will add, commit and push.

Lots of ove!
